# SynonymMapBuilder

This code is to build synonym map using Wordnet to use in a Synonym Filter (https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_2_1/analyzers-common/org/apache/lucene/analysis/synonym/SynonymFilter.html).
This was built for indexing and searching TREC docs. The input documents(http://trec.nist.gov) and the stanford jars 
(https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/) are removed.
